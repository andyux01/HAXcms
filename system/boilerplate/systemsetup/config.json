The point cloud is\n    converted into a mesh, which is a solid 3D model, and the texture data captured by\n    the scanner is mapped back onto the mesh to add color, markings, and other details.\n    The final 3D model can be exported into other software platforms, such as Blender\n    and Instant Mesh, both of which are open-source.</p>\n\n    <p data-hax-layout=\"true\" =\"true\"=\"\" slot=\"col-1\">To optimize the model for web use, it must be reduced significantly in size. To\n    achieve this, the polygon count is reduced using Instant Mesh, and the resulting\n    low-polygon model is unwrapped, and the texture and additional details are added\n    through a process called “baking” onto the model using normal mapping. This is a\n    commonly used technique in film and video game production to reduce file sizes, processing\n    power, and other resources required.</p>\n\n <media-image citation=\"3D scanner and software shown scanning an ODL coffee mug.\" accent-color=\"grey\" size=\"wide\" offset=\"none\" slot=\"col-2\" source=\"https://bones.courses.science.psu.edu/assets/images/scanning-page-images/scanner-odl.jpg\" card box></media-image>"
